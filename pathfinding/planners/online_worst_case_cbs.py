"""
A trivial online planner that utilizes CBS to solve graphs with time uncertainty. A TU problem is given as input, and a
solution is found for the case where each edge has the maximal time possible. During execution, after traversing an edge
and sensing, an agent waits the appropriate number of time steps in order to synchronize with the initial plan.
Note that this algorithm does not require any communication, but it does require full sensing.
